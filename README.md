# DeepL-Mobile

Welcome all here. First of all. This an **unofficial** DeepL mobile app.

This repo exists because I saw some guys trying to steal DeepL's revenue by making a web browser app to DeepL's site and adding ads to it. So, this is just a similar browser app but **without Ads**!!

## Main features

What is more, it provides Android Integration so you can translate with DeepL easier!

~~Even better then one that contains add on the store~~

## FAQ

Q: Isn't this just another rip-off from DeepL?
A: No, the app does not contain any component that makes money for me.

Q: Why should I trust you?
A: If you don't trust me, trust the code!

Q: This sounds too good. Why would you do this?
A: I created the app purely for myself such that I can benefit from DeepL on my phone. It doesn't make sense to rip myself off at all!
